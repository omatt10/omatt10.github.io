        <h1>The Devine Cinnamon Roll Deli</h1>
        <h2>Location: 2617 Devine St, Columbia, South Carolina</h2>
        <p>
            Tucked away in Columbia, The Divine Cinnamon Roll Deli has been a local favorite 
            since 1993. What started as a simple cinnamon roll bakery has evolved into a 
            beloved breakfast and lunch spot that keeps locals coming back for more. 
            Their signature cinnamon rolls are legendary - massive, gooey, and made fresh 
            daily with a secret family recipe. But don't sleep on their deli sandwiches and 
            breakfast options, which are equally impressive. The cozy, no-frills atmosphere 
            makes it the perfect spot for a casual meal with friends or a quick bite between 
            classes.

        <h2>Crowd/Personal Favorites</h2>
        <p> 
            Walking into The Divine Cinnamon Roll Deli, you're immediately hit with the warm, 
            sweet aroma of fresh-baked cinnamon rolls. The space is cozy and casual with a no-frills,
            homey vibe that feels authentically local, though seating is limited so it's 
            more grab-and-go than a hangout spot. The staff is friendly and efficient,
            especially during the morning rush when lines can stretch out the door on weekends.
            For the best experience, hit it on a weekday mid-morning around 10 AM to avoid crowds 
            and ensure they still have a full selection of flavors. Pro tip: popular varieties like 
            the strawberry cinnamon roll can sell out by early afternoon, so get there early or call ahead!
